<h2>Welcome to iCAST 2023</h2>

<p>The 12th International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology (iCAST 2023) will be hosted by Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan. “Awareness” is the ability to be conscious of, feel, or perceive (Wikipedia). This implies vigilance in observation and alertness in drawing inferences from what one experiences (Merriam-Webster). The ultimate goal of awareness computing is to create computing systems that are themselves aware. This conference has been evolved from the International Workshop on Aware Computing (IWAC 2009), in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, the International Symposium on Aware Computing (ISAC 2010) in Tainan, Taiwan, the International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology (iCAST 2011) in Dalian, China, iCAST 2012 in Seoul, Korea, iCAST 2013 in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, iCAST 2014 in Paris, France, iCAST 2015 in Qinhuangdao, China, iCAST 2017 in Taichung, Taiwan, iCAST 2018 in Manado, Indonesia, and iCAST 2019 in Morioka, Japan. The conference provides a forum for researchers, engineers, and scientists for discussing awareness computing and exchanging ideas, opinions, and the latest results in this emerging new field.</p>
<p>All accepted regular papers will be published by Conference Publishing Service (CPS) of IEEE and submitted to IEEE Xplore digital library. Please notice that CPS enforces a "NO SHOW” policy and only papers that are presented by an author at the conference site will be sent for inclusion in the digital libraries. Also they are submitted for indexing in EI (Compendex) and Scopus. Selected papers will be recommended for post-conference publication in some Science Citation Index Expanded, EI, or Scopus journals, such as International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering, International Journal of Embedded Systems, International Journal of High Performance Computing and Networking, International Journal of Network Security, and International Journal of Applied Science and Engineeringy.</p>
<p>It is our great pleasure to have you with us at the conference and hope you will enjoy all events we prepare and have a fruitful experiences and a wonderful stay in Taichung City. Press here to obtain</p>
